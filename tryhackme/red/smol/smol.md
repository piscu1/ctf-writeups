# Smol

This room is a red challenge in which the description tells us directly that this is a **WordPress** website which has a publicly known vulnerable plugin, highlighting the risks of neglecting software updates and security patches. 

## Recon

We start by doing a normal port scan with Nmap and find 2 open ports. I leave the all port scan running into the background so I can see if there's any ports that aren't visible in the top 1000, but we find nothing but the **SSH** on port **22** and the **HTTP** on port **80**.

I try to see how **port 80** is looking, but when I try to access it it tells me we can't connect to the server at **www.smol.thm**, so I go and add it at /etc/hosts.

![Can't connect to the server](./screenshots/recon2.png)

I start navigating the main page and meanwhile, I will put a directory scan to search if we can find anything that we don't see on the main page.

If we scroll all the way down, the hint at the beggining of the challenge of it being **WordPress** is being confirmed.

To be honest, I've never done any WordPress room, or at least I can't remember one, so it's gonna be a first on my part. I tried doing a WPScan on it and this is what it returned.

wpscan --url www.smol.thm
