# CTF Write-ups by piscu

Welcome to my personal collection of **CTF (Capture The Flag) write-ups**.  
This repository is my learning space, knowledge base, and a small contribution to the infosec community.

## About This Repo

This project:

- Documents some of the **CTF rooms, challenges, and flags** I’ve completed.
- Is written to help **others who are stuck** on the same rooms or challenges.
- Tracks my **progress** as I improve in areas like web exploitation, reverse engineering, crypto, pwn, and more.
- Helps **reinforce what I’ve learned** through clear explanations and step-by-step breakdowns.

## Structure

Write-ups are organized by **platform** and **category**.  
Each challenge has its own Markdown file including:

- Challenge description  
- Enumeration & exploitation steps  
- The flag (how it was found)  
- Key takeaways  
- Screenshots where useful

## Why I Made This

Writing things down makes me a better hacker.  
By explaining how I solved each challenge, I:

- Deepen my understanding  
- Spot patterns in different categories  
- Track my learning journey  
- Help others get unstuck and maybe learn
